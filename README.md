# Coding-Interview-Questions
Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your background. They're looking for:
- **Metacognition** - About coding. Do you think about how to code well?
- **Ownership/leadership** - Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?
- **Communication** -  Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?
