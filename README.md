# Coding-Interview-Questions
Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your
background. They're looking for:
- **Metacognition** - About coding. Do you think about how to code well?
- **Ownership/leadership** - Do you see your work through to completion? Do you
  fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?
- **Communication** -  Would chatting with you about a technical problem be
  useful or painful?

  *`If all you know how to do is write glue code, you may call yourself a code
  monkey. Lots of glue code needs to be written and you can make a decent living
  as a code monkey. To call yourself a Real Programmer TM and be trusted when code
  needs to be written from scratch, you have to know algorithms, data structures,
  memory management, pointers, assembly language, etc. and understand how to use
  this knowledge to evaluate trade offs.`*

You should have at least one:
----------------------------------

- example of an interesting technical problem you solved
- example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame
- example of leadership or ownership
- story about what you should have done differently in a past project
- piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't
  like about said language
- question about the company's product/business
- question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)

Within this repository, I will be adding all the coding interview related
problems here with solutions.

Feel free to use them and make them efficient in any way.
