# Coding-Interview-Questions
Before diving into code, most interviewers like to chitchat about your background. They're looking for:
- **Metacognition** - About coding. Do you think about how to code well?
- **Ownership/leadership** - Do you see your work through to completion? Do you fix things that aren't quite right, even if you don't have to?
- **Communication** -  Would chatting with you about a technical problem be useful or painful?

You should have at least one:
----------------------------------

- example of an interesting technical problem you solved
- example of an interpersonal conflict you overcame 
- example of leadership or ownership
- story about what you should have done differently in a past project
- piece of trivia about your favorite language, and something you do and don't like about said language
- question about the company's product/business
- question about the company's engineering strategy (testing, Scrum, etc)
