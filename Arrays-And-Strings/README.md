#Uniqueness Of Given String

Implement an algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters. What if
you can not use additional data structures?

######**`Insure:`**
  1. *The complexity time of given algorithm is O(n).*
  2. *The space complexity of given algorithm is O(n).*
  3. *You need to consider ASCII chars as well.*
